# What Is CSS? üßê </br>

CSS stands for **Cascading style sheet**. Its a language for how documents websites are presented, styled and laid out. CSS allows you to create Decorative webpages and control what HTML looks like.

**CSS Syntax** </br>
CSS follows certain rules. CSS starts off with a HTML selector for instants (< h1>). From here we can style the heading but first we need to add curly braces{}. Inside the curly braces we can enter certain properties to customize (< h1 >) like color or font-size. </br>  
h1 { </br>
color: red;  
 font-size: 5em;

}
