Mac = text editor vs Windows = Notepad. HTML folder is labeled "index.html" and CSS folder is labeled "style.css" Its impoartant for the documents to be labeled properly so that we know what type of code we are writing.

For beginers its best to have no text editor because you would have to find your won errors and learn from them. The difference between Text editor and IDE's is that text edit edits texts and IDE's is a text editor, file manager, and debuggs a computer all in one.
