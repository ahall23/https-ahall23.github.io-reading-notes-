**Control Flow!** </br>
**Control flow** - is the order the
computer follow the statements in a script.  
Code is ran in order from the first line of code to the last line unless you have conditionals and loops which are structures that change the control flow.  
A **loop** is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met.
Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
