# Class 01- Mindset and Coding

<h1> <em> Introduction ~ </em> </h1>

<p> My name is Alexia Hall and I am from Memphis, TN. I am currently 23 and I've been a bit of a career jumper. I have done door to door marketing, digitization, curation for a museum, Social media managing and was a operator, working with machines. I went to school for Physical therapy and fine art. Now I'm learning how to code and for the first time ever I have proven to myself that coding is something I want to do for the long run. How so, you say? Well, it started with my mindset. I had to change my mindset in order to be consistant and to seek longivity in this feild. Although its good to keep your hands in many things how do you manage when you want to stop and feel discouraged. Coding can be challenging and its important to have a growing mindset entering the feild. </p>
