# Class 01- Mindset and Coding

## _Introduction_ ~

My name is Alexia Hall and I am from Memphis, TN. I am currently 23 and I've been a bit of a career jumper. I have done door to door marketing, digitization, curation for a museum, Social media managing and was a operator, working with machines. I went to school for Physical therapy and fine art. Now I'm learning how to code and for the first time ever I have proven to myself that coding is something I want to do for the long run. How so, you say? Well, it started with my mindset. I had to change my mindset in order to be consistant and to seek longivity in this feild. Although its good to keep your hands in many things its important to manage yourself when you want to stop and feel discouraged. Coding can be challenging and its important to have a growing mindset entering the feild. 

### What is a Growth mindset?
A growth mindset is the ability to constantly improve one's fundemental abilities through perserverence and effort.

#### Five things I will do to maintain a growing mindset.
1. When I am Faced with challenges I will evaluate the situation and take a step back if I have to
2. When obstacles get in my way, I will take a small break in a quite space and breathe. Come back to the obstacle and slove it in 15 to 30min increments. 
3. I will maintain effort by asking myself guided questions.
4. To maintain a healthy outlook on criticism I will take in what resonate, I will leave what does not and will question things that might.
5. When it come to success of others... girl! embrace, learn and become a spondge. Soak everything in.There's no hating over here only grace and networking.
