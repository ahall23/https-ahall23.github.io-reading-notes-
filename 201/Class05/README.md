Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community. **Imagine you taking a picture with the poloroid cameras at a function and uncle who had too many drinks takes a picture and its blury. Its kinda like GIFs. GIF, just like other image formats, are not resolution-independent, and will therefore look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. Now having a sober uncle taking a photo will get you a better resloution.SVG is scalable and resolution-independent, and will look crisp clear on any screen resolution.**

What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why? **JPEG: This is an ideal image format for all types of photographs. PNG: This format is perfect for screenshots and other types of imagery where there's not a lot of color data.**

Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge. **Imagine you are on those thick block computers and you want to virtually draw and paint. Well, when you pick your brush or pencil and decide what color it wil be that will be called foreground.foreground controls what color your brush or pencil will be, while the background color erases any added color and replaces it with the background color, which is white by default.**

Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? **I would go into CSS and add a background color to the body and maybe add color to the borders of the < h1> tags**

What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements? **It changes the size of the text, changes how bold or thin you want the text and changes style of the text.**

Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
