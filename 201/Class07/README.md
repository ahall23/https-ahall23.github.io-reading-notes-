## Domain Modeling

> Explain why we need domain modeling.
> **So to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics.**

### HTML Table Basics

> Why should tables not be used for page layouts? The tables are not responsive. **It can be harder for you to write and debugg and Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users.**

> List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table. **header, section, article**

### Introducing Constructors

> What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**Constructors are methods that are automatically executed every time you create an object.**

> How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**When a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script for an object literal. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script.**

#### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

> Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
> NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
